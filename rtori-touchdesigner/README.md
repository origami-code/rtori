## Plugins

|Kind |Name (prefixed `RTOri`) |Description                                              |State|
|-----|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|:---:|
|SOP  | `Simulate`             | Simulates an origami folding                            |ðŸš§|
|CHOP | `Simulate`             | Simulates an origami folding                            |ðŸŽ¯|
|TOP  | `Simulate`             | Simulates an origami folding                            |ðŸŽ¯|
|POP *| `Simulate`             | Simulates an origami folding                            |ðŸŽ¯|
|DAT  | `FoldSelectFrame`      | Parses a fold file, outputs a single frame              |ðŸŽ¯|
|DAT  | `FoldSelect`           | Parses a fold file/frame, outputs the requested fields  |ðŸŽ¯|
|DAT  | `FoldAdd`              | Adds vertices to a fold file, possibly linking them     |ðŸŽ¯|
|DAT  | `SOPToFold`            | Converts a surface (SOP) into a fold file               |ðŸŽ¯|
|POP *| `POPToFold`            | Converts a surface (POP) into a fold file               |ðŸŽ¯|

(*):`POP` or Particle Operator(s) haven't been released yet. They promise increased performance for surface operations.


All the `Simulate` custom operators can be either linked to a fold file,
or to another one which is linked to a fold file, so as to cheapily add a new output from the same simulation.

All the `..Fold..` custom operators also provide access to python queries, read-only.

## Platform/Architecture Support

|macOS    |X86_64      |ðŸŽ¯   |
|macOS    |arm64       |ðŸŽ¯   |

ðŸŽ¯: a target, not currently running

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture

The plugins depend on a common library `rtori-td-common.{dll,dylib}`, providing core functionality in a TD-compatible outfit, with dynamic/shared linkage. This also reduces the size of the plugins.

#### `RTOriSimulate...`

All the `RTOriSimulate...` plugins depend on another shared library,
`RTOriSimulateShared`, which provides the base class.

This allows the different plugins to cast the objects of the other classes (`RTOriSimulate...`)
to a common one which provides the required operations to access the simulation.

### Windows on Arm64

For Windows on arm64, there is currently (2025-01-21) no native release for arm64.
Some people have had success with the built-in emulation from Windows.

To accelerate the CPU-heavy code of this plugin, we could build it as well as dependencies as [`ARM64EC`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/arm64ec).

### macOS

There should be no troubles besides testing.
